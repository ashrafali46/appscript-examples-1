## Appscript Examples

This repo contains small scripts I've written to automate tasks in Google applications (Gmail, Sheets, and Docs). Please see comments in each file to determine what should be updated to apply these functions to your own.

Many of the projects in this repo are dependent on timers or run on edit. Choose what works best for you.
